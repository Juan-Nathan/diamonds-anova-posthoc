# ðŸ’Ž Advanced Hypothesis Testing on Diamonds: ANOVA & Post Hoc Tests

This project demonstrates the application of **one-way ANOVA**, **two-way ANOVA**, and **post hoc Tukey HSD tests** in Python using a diamonds dataset.
It explores how diamond prices vary across color grades and cut categories, and whether there are interaction effects between these factors.

## Dataset

- `diamonds.csv`: One-way ANOVA
- `diamonds2.csv`: Two-way ANOVA
- **Source**: [Seaborn diamonds dataset](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- **Contents**: Diamond prices across different color grades and cut categories

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`

## Methods Applied
- **One-Way ANOVA**: Tests whether mean diamond prices differ across color grades.
- **Two-Way ANOVA**: Tests whether mean diamond prices differ across both color and cut, including their interaction.
- **Post Hoc Tukey HSD Test**: Performs pairwise comparisons of diamond color grades following one-way ANOVA.

## How to Run
